# Instructions

This exercise consists of analysing tests from a project, written in the course of the IFI SoPra Module in spring 2022. Write your opinion about the test suites by answering the following questions.

1. What do you think about how the test suites are structured at highlevel? Would you do it the same, and if not, what would you do differently?
2. What are advantages of structuring the test suites the way they are, what are disadvantages?
3. What do you think about the naming folders containing tests and the names of the test classes? Pick some good and some bad examples and explain what you find helpful about the naming or what not.

Write your answers in a `answer.md` file that you put in this folder.
